# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Enhancement

This lab explores **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to simplify complex datasets while retaining key information.  

## What’s Inside?
- **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values and standardizing features.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction** – Applying PCA to reduce features and improve efficiency.  
- **Visualization** – Plotting explained variance and principal components.  
- **Comparison** – Analyzing model performance before and after PCA.  

## Files:
- `Lab_PCA.ipynb` – Complete implementation and analysis.  
- `README.md` – Quick overview of the lab.
