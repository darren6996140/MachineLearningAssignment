# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Enhancement

This lab explores **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to simplify complex datasets while retaining key information.  

## What’s Inside?
- **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values and standardizing features.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction** – Applying PCA to reduce features and improve efficiency.  
- **Visualization** – Plotting explained variance and principal components.  
- **Comparison** – Analyzing model performance before and after PCA.  

## Files:
- `3_LabEnhancements_PCA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full implementation.
- `README.md`: Overview of the lab.

A **detailed explanation** is available inside the Jupyter Notebook.
