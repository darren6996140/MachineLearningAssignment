# Linear Regression Enhancement

This lab extends **Linear Regression** with additional techniques for better understanding and application.

## Key Enhancements:
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection.
- **Model Improvement**: Compared **Simple vs. Multiple Linear Regression**.
- **Evaluation**: Used **R² Score, RMSE, and Cross-Validation**.
- **Visualization**: Plotted residuals and regression lines for insights.

## Files:
- `Lab_LinearRegression.ipynb` – Full implementation.
- `README.md` – Overview of enhancements.

More details are available in the Jupyter Notebook.
