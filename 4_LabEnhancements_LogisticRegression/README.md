# Logistic Regression Enhancement

This lab expands on **Logistic Regression**, a key classification algorithm, by exploring its applications and performance.

## What’s Inside?
- **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical data.
- **Model Building** – Implementing Logistic Regression for classification tasks.
- **Performance Evaluation** – Using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- **Comparison** – Evaluating Logistic Regression against other classification models.

## Files:
- `4_Lab_LogisticRegression.ipynb` – Full implementation with explanations.
- `README.md` – Overview of the lab.
